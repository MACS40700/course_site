## Evaluation philosophy

The university requires that I assign each student a letter grade at the end of the quarter. However I find that numeric scores on assignments tend to cause students grading anxiety if they do not achieve a perfect 100%. Nor does the numeric score convey specific feedback as to what the student has done well on an assignment, combined with feedback on areas for improvement.

As such, I do not assign numeric scores in this class. All homework assignments are evaluated using the grading rubric below. Final grades are calculated as the cumulative performance across all homework assignments. 
<!--
Failure to complete the two weekly [peer evaluation assignments](/faq/peer-evaluations/) causes a minor deduction in the final grade.
-->

## How do the rubric scores convert to a letter grade?

<!--
One year on my course evaluations a student commented

> [T]he grading policy is locked in some chest somewhere under the ocean

Let's pull back the curtain and demystify how I calculate final grade! 
-->

* In this course, "Satisfactory" is equivalent to a B+. So if you earned "Satisfactory" on every assignment for every rubric element, at the end of the quarter you would earn a B+. 
* If you earn a combination of "Satisfactory" and "Excellent" scores you are looking at the difference between a B+ and an A-, or an A- and an A. 
* If you earn a combination of "Satisfactory" and "Needs Improvement" scores, then you might be somewhere between a B+ and a B or lower.
* Etc. etc.

<--Historically, 90% of students in the class earn a B+ or higher.--> 

The final grade is calculated assuming you are submitting all homework assignments and the final project. Missed assignments or incomplete work will negatively affect your grade. A missed assignment is worth 0%.



## Rubric

*In addition to this general rubric, make sure to consult any specific guidance given in the relevant assignment itself*

Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs improvement: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|-----------| ---------------------- |--------------------------| ----------------------|
|**Truthfulness of graphic**| Visualizations are accurate representations of underlying phenomena. | Some misleading or confusing aspects of the graph. | Visualization misrepresents underlying data in a significant and/or meaningful way.    <br><br>|
|**Functionality of graphic** | Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point. <br><br> Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features. <br><br> Full command of Markdown syntax and its components. | Graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels. <br><br> Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies. <br><br> Appropriate use of Markdown syntax and its components, but with some minor deficiencies. | Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions. <br><br> Table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. <br><br> Major display problems with graphs, tables and/or Markdown components.<br><br>|
|**Beauty of graphic**| Visualizations follow design principles from class, have excellent use of color and design and are noteworthy in overall aesthetic. | Visualizations generally follow principles from class but some room for improvement.  | Significant issues with visualizations. <br><br>    |
|**Insight and enlightening-ness** |Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course and/or shows sophisticated application of tools from course.|Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps, somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition.|Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.<br><br>|
|**Technical aspects, e.g. Coding style**| Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding conventions are followed, code is well commented. | Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments. | Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable.<br><br>|
|**Reproducibility, compliance with course conventions for submitted work**|Access is as easy as possible, comply with reproducibility conventions, code runs, workflow is correct. | Code partially complies with reproducibility conventions and/or code does not run. | Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions and/or code does not run.|
