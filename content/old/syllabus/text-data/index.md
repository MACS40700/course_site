## Overview

* Introduce regular expressions
* Identify the basic workflow for conducting text analysis
* Define the tidy text formats (Chapter 1)
* Word frequencies and tf-idf (Chapter 1 and 3)

<!-- 
* Demonstrate how to conduct sentiment analysis using twitter
* Explain how to generate and interpret a wordcloud -->


## Before class

For this and the following lecture we use the book [*Tidy Text Mining with R*](http://tidytextmining.com/). Before this class: read Chapter 1, 3, and 4. Before next class: read chapters 2 and 6

## Additional resources

**Basic text analysis:**
* The three case studies included in the book "Text Mining with R" (see assigned readings) provide in-depth examples on how to preform text analysis from A-Z. I recommend Chapter 9  [Case study: analyzing usenet text](https://www.tidytextmining.com/usenet.html)
* For an excellent theoretical explanation of these topics see [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) by Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin, especially Chapter 2, 3, and 4

**Regular Expressions:**
* [Chapter 14](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#strings) of our textbook *R for Data Science* 
* [Chapter 15](https://plsc-31101.github.io/course/strings-and-regular-expressions.html#applying-regex)  by Rochelle Terman, explains `stringr()` (using the *R for Data Science* textbook)  
* For an overview of regular expressions in R see [Chapter 17](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/regular-expressions.html#the-stringr-package) from *R Programming for Data Science*. This book covers the entire range of regular expressions packages and functions; in-class we focus only on the `stringr()` package
* [`stringr()` documentation and cheatsheet](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)
