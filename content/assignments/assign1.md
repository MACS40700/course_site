summary: Critique and improve a visualization 
---

## Visualization critique (5 points)

Select a data visualization and write a (roughly) 1000 word critique of
the visualization based on the five qualities of great
visualizations:[^1]

- Is it truthful?
- Is it functional?
- Is it beautiful?
- Is it insightful?
- Is it enlightening?

Remember that to critique something does not mean to tear it down or
find all the flaws. Critiques should include both positive and negative
aspects - what did the author do well? What are the weaknesses of the
visualization? How could the truthfulness of the visualization be
improved?

#### Finding a visualization

Some good resources for finding visualizations to critique:

- Academic journals/books in your field which include graphs or charts
  (you don’t have to find some super-duper high tech interactive graph
  on the web)
- [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/)
- Nathan Yau’s [Flowing Data blog](http://flowingdata.com/)
- [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) or [The
  Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot) - or really any other
  data journalism site

#### Submission details

Be sure to include a link to the original visualization in your
critique. Submit your critique as a
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) formatted
document that can be read directly in the repo on GitHub. Write either
in the original `.md` file or write it as an [R
Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document rendered using the
`github_output` format.
