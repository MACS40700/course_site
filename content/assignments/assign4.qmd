# Assignment 4: Tableau dashboard
For this assignment



## Can I use different data?

YES! If you have another dataset around which you want to build an interactive visualization, go ahead! Just check in with me before you proceed.

## Grading

Your visualization will be evaluated using the following criteria:

* Is it truthful?
* Is it functional?
* Is it beautiful?
* Is it insightful?
* Is it enlightening?

In addition to the visualization and accompanying narrative, write an approximately 500 word explanation defending your design choices. This includes (but is not limited to):

* What is the story?
* Why did you select this graphical form?
* What is the role of interactivity? How does it enhance your ability to tell the story and communicate the data?

## Submission details

Submit your visualization and analysis as a single R Markdown document rendered using the `html_document` output format. If you build a Shiny app, deploy it on [Tableau Public](http://www.shinyapps.io) and include a link to it in your submission on [github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/VXiJO03N). Include your design explanation a document on GitHub. Note that expectations remain the same regarding an explantion of your data, github organization, etc.
