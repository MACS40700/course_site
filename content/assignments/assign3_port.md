# Portfolio

This is a smaller scale version of the final project to give practice and feedback before you commit to a larger project. You may work in groups of up to three individuals for this assignment.

You will need to provide a minimum of three graphs and a maximum of five. All graphs should be essential for understanding your research question of interest, well-designed, polished, and clear to an outside reader. There will be an accompanying writeup that has two components: a discussion of the findings in the graphs and an assessment of the overall design.

## Assessment

Your project will be assessed on the following criteria:[^1]

-   Is it truthful?
-   Is it functional?
-   Is it beautiful?
-   Is it insightful?
-   Is it enlightening?

## Final Deliverables

Submit final deliverables to your GitHub repo.

The final deliverables include:

-   **Visualization**: the final product of your project. This could be a Markdown/HTML/PDF file of your research paper, a link to a Shiny app or web page hosting your visualization, etc. If this is located outside of the GitHub repository, make sure to include a link in your `README.md` file. If you are wanting to use a Shiny app but are waiting until we cover it later in the course, you can provide some prototypes instead (coordinate this with us.)
-   **Paper**: a 2-3 page paper (approx 750 words give or take 150 words) to supplement your visualization explaining your major design choices. Expected components are:
    -   **Introduction** - an explanation of the problem/research question and the motivation for solving it.
    -   **Methods** - a detailed explanation of the visualization techniques you employed to solve the problem/answer the question.
    -   **Results/discussion** - what has the audience learned from your work? How is the visualization truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and/or enlightening?
-   **Readme**: In the repository's `README.md`, include a brief project description and instructions for a user to execute your code on their own computer (e.g.Â what software/packages to install, instructions to obtain data if not included in repo). Aim for your project to be *reproducible*. If you work with a partner, include a description of which components each of you contributed to the project.
-   **Code**: an implementation of your source code. Make sure your code is well-documented and interpretable to outsiders.

## Getting started

All work will be performed inside a version-controlled GitHub repo. Create your project repo by going [to this link on github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/-2jxXYJ2)
