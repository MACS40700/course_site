# Tasks

## Assessment

Assignment Requirements Summary  
You will create geographic visualizations that reveal spatial patterns and tell compelling stories through cartographic design. You MUST have social-science data for this, in addition to spatial data.

Follow this sequence:

### Choose and Describe Your Dataset

-   **Data Requirements:** Select a dataset with geographic components (countries, states, cities, regions, etc.) and at least one quantitative or categorical variable to map
-   **Data Sources:** You may collect data from online sources, APIs, government databases, or use existing datasets with spatial information
-   **Data Preparation:** Clean and prepare your data for geographic analysis, including proper handling of geographic identifiers (country codes, state abbreviations, etc.)
-   **Describe your dataset:** source, variables of interest, geographic scope, and what story you want to tell
-   **Ensure your data can be meaningfully linked to geographic boundaries** and that you have sufficient coverage for effective visualization.

### Create Your Geographic Visualizations

Your submission must include at least **two different types of maps:**

-   **Choropleth Map:** Show quantitative data across geographic regions using color intensity or categories
-   **Alternative Map Type:** Choose from point maps, graduated symbols, cartograms, or other cartographic techniques that complement your story

## Technical Requirements:

-   Use appropriate map projections (avoid distorting Mercator when showing global patterns)
-   Include proper legends, scales, and geographic context
-   Handle missing data appropriately (don't force zeros where data doesn't exist)
-   Use colorblind-friendly palettes when appropriate

### Demonstrate Data Processing Skills

Your work should include:

-   **Data Cleaning:** Show how you prepared and cleaned your geographic data
-   **Spatial Joins:** Demonstrate linking your data to geographic boundaries
-   **Data Transformation:** Include necessary data reshaping, aggregation, or conversion processes

### Analysis and Narrative (750-1000 words)

Write a comprehensive analysis that includes:

-   **Data Description:** Source, collection method, limitations, and scope
-   **Geographic Patterns:** What spatial patterns emerge from your visualizations?
-   **Design Justification:** Why did you choose these map types and design elements?
-   **Insights:** What non-obvious findings does your geographic analysis reveal?
-   **Broader Context:** How do your findings connect to larger geographic, social, or economic questions?

Your narrative should weave together the technical aspects of cartographic design with substantive insights about spatial patterns.

Your plots will be assessed on the following criteria:[^1]

-   Is it truthful?
-   Is it functional?
-   Is it beautiful?
-   Is it insightful?
-   Is it enlightening?

## Getting started

All work will be performed inside a version-controlled GitHub repo. Create your project repo by going [to this link on github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/h-1E1990)
