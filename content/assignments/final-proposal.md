summary: "Final project proposal: checkpoint"
---

### Overview

This is a check-point for your final project. The final project needs to contain an interactive or animated element and needs to be of sufficient scope to provide insight about your topic of choice. If you aren't sure about how to expand the scope, please check in! You can post on Ed and/or attend office hours.

You have two options for this assignment and only need to submit one of the following:

1.  Submit your assignment 2 writeup with the following information added in a new section: (ideally you are building on a previous work, but you can choose to focus on a brief summary).

-   What feedback you received
-   How you will incorporate that feedback
-   How you will expand the project for the final -- include a sketch or prototype of your expansion.

**OR**

1.  A new project proposal. For this, complete the assignment 2 objectives (providing one graph and at least THREE prototypes). The same criteria apply as above (must have animation or interactive element). The project scope needs to be of sufficient size as well.

In either case, submit a link to your relevant repo (it can be your assignment 2/3 repo or you can use the final project repo: https://classroom.github.com/a/GVYlvom8 ).
