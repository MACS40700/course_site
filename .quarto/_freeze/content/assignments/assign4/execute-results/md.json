If you have another dataset around which you want to build an interactive visualization, go ahead! Just check in with me before you proceed.\n\n## Grading\n\nYour visualization will be evaluated using the following criteria:\n\n* Is it truthful?\n* Is it functional?\n* Is it beautiful?\n* Is it insightful?\n* Is it enlightening?\n\nIn addition to the visualization and accompanying narrative, write an approximately 500 word explanation defending your design choices. This includes (but is not limited to):\n\n* What is the story?\n* Why did you select this graphical form?\n* What is the role of interactivity? How does it enhance your ability to tell the story and communicate the data?\n\n## Submission details\n\nSubmit your visualization and analysis as a single R Markdown document rendered using the `html_document` output format. If you build a Shiny app, deploy it on [Tableau Public](http://www.shinyapps.io) and include a link to it in your submission on [github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/VXiJO03N). Include your design explanation a document on GitHub. Note that expectations remain the same regarding an explantion of your data, github organization, etc. \n\n",
