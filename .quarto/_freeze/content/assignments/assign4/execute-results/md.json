The data can be downloaded here: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html \n\nYou need at least three plots, one that is temporally focused and one that focuses upon a different aspect (for example, name gender or state popularity). \n\nInclude clear labeling and explanations, interactivity, and a mixture of graphics and tables, as appropriate (e.g. you cannot have only one graph, or only one graph type). \n\nThis needs to allow readers to answer a particular question -- for example, how name trends have changed or geographic trends. \n\n\n\n\n## Can I use different data?\n\nYES! If you have another dataset around which you want to build an interactive visualization, go ahead! Just check in with us before you proceed. Note that as of right now, your visualization will need to be published to Tableau public, so you may wish to use publicly available data. \n\n## Grading\n\nYour visualization will be evaluated using the following criteria:\n\n* Is it truthful?\n* Is it functional?\n* Is it beautiful?\n* Is it insightful?\n* Is it enlightening?\n\nIn addition to the visualization and accompanying narrative, write an approximately 500 word explanation defending your design choices. This includes (but is not limited to):\n\n* What is the story?\n* Why did you select this graphical form?\n* What is the role of interactivity? How does it enhance your ability to tell the story and communicate the data?\n\n## Submission details\n\nSubmit your visualization and analysis, including a link to your Tableau site and a PDF to ensure we have access in case something goes awry. Include your design explanation within the document (you can include an additional tab, if needed). Note that expectations remain the same regarding an explanation of your data, organization, etc. \n\n",
