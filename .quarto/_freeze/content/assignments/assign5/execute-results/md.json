For this assignment, you should build an interactive visualization to tell a story about the data. **This assignment requires you to develop both the visualization as well as a written narrative.**\n\n* You do not need to analyze all 500+ variables. You can focus on a small set of variables (whichever ones you wish, though check the indicator's coverage for all the countries and the time period available)\n* You can build either a highly linear or non-linear structure to your visualization. For instance, you can write up an analysis of the data as an R Markdown document/website with interactive visualizations incorporated throughout the analysis, or build a Shiny application with which users can explore the data. Choose whichever format you find more appealing. Note that if you design a non-linear interactive visualization, you still need to situate it using an introduction or text description (a la [America's Public Bible](http://americaspublicbible.org/)^[Though with far less detail]. See FA ch 9 for more details.)\n* [gapminder](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html) only contains data on three variables. You will need to obtain additional indicators from Gapminder's [data page](http://www.gapminder.org/data/). Unfortunately they don't have a friendly API to access their database - each variable has to be downloaded manually as an Excel spreadsheet and imported into R. The following basic function should allow you to import a downloaded spreadsheet into R,^[You could also rewrite it to directly import from Google Sheets using the `googlesheets` package, making it fully reproducible.] and tidy:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nimport_gapminder <- function(filename, inc_name = NA){\n  # import file\n  indicator <- read_excel(filename)\n  \n  # rename first column to country, store indicator name for later\n  inc_fullname <- names(indicator)[[1]]\n  names(indicator)[[1]] <- \"country\"\n  \n  # tidy data frame and add indicator name as variable\n  indicator <- indicator %>%\n    gather(year, value, -1, convert = TRUE) %>%\n    mutate(value = as.numeric(value),\n           variable = ifelse(!is.na(inc_name), inc_name, inc_fullname)) %>%\n    select(country, year, variable, value)\n}\n\n# use default name\n# (import_gapminder(\"data/indicator hiv estimated prevalence% 15-49 (1).xlsx\"))\n# \n# # use custom label\n# (import_gapminder(\"data/indicator hiv estimated prevalence% 15-49 (1).xlsx\",\n#                   inc_name = \"hiv_15_49\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Can I use some different data?\n\nYES! If you have another dataset around which you want to build an interactive visualization, go ahead! Just check in with me before you proceed.\n\n## Grading\n\nYour visualization will be evaluated using the following criteria:\n\n* Is it truthful?\n* Is it functional?\n* Is it beautiful?\n* Is it insightful?\n* Is it enlightening?\n\nIn addition to the visualization and accompanying narrative, write an approximately 500 word explanation defending your design choices. This includes (but is not limited to):\n\n* What is the story?\n* Why did you select this graphical form?\n* What is the role of interactivity? How does it enhance your ability to tell the story and communicate the data?\n\n## Submission details\n\nSubmit your visualization and analysis as a single R Markdown document rendered using the `html_document` output format. If you build a Shiny app, deploy it on [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io) and include a link to it in your submission on [github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/QiYvVFqi). Include your design explanation in a separate tab in the shiny app.\n\n",
