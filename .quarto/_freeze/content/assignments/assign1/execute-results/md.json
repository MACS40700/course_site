Critiques should include both positive and negative aspects - what did the author do well? What are the weaknesses of the visualization? How could the truthfulness of the visualization be improved?\n\n#### Finding a visualization\n\nSome good resources for finding visualizations to critique:\n\n* Academic journals/books in your field which include graphs or charts (you don't have to find some super-duper high tech interactive graph on the web)\n* [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/)\n* Nathan Yau's [Flowing Data blog](http://flowingdata.com/)\n* [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) or [The Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot) - or really any other data journalism site\n\n#### Submission details\n\nBe sure to include a link to the original visualization in your critique. Submit your critique as a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) formatted document that can be read directly in the repo on GitHub. Write either in the original `.md` file or write it as an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document rendered using the `github_output` format.\n\n<!--## Part 2: `ggplot2` and the grammar of graphics (10 points)-->",
