For this assignment, you should build an interactive visualization to tell a story about the data. **This assignment requires you to develop both the visualization as well as a written narrative.**\n\n* You do not need to analyze all 500+ variables. You can focus on a small set of variables (whichever ones you wish, though check the indicator's coverage for all the countries and the time period available)\n* You can build either a highly linear or non-linear structure to your visualization. Note that if you design a non-linear interactive visualization, you still need to situate it using an introduction or text description (a la [America's Public Bible](http://americaspublicbible.org/)^[Though with far less detail]. See FA ch 9 for more details.)\n* Note: [gapminder](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html) only contains data on three variables. You will need to obtain additional indicators from Gapminder's [data page](http://www.gapminder.org/data/). Unfortunately they don't have a friendly API to access their database - each variable has to be downloaded manually as an Excel spreadsheet and imported into R. The following basic function should allow you to import a downloaded spreadsheet into R,^[You could also rewrite it to directly import from Google Sheets using the `googlesheets` package, making it fully reproducible.] and tidy:\n\n```{r import-gapminder, message = FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nimport_gapminder <- function(filename, inc_name = NA){\n  # import file\n  indicator <- read_excel(filename)\n  \n  # rename first column to country, store indicator name for later\n  inc_fullname <- names(indicator)[[1]]\n  names(indicator)[[1]] <- \"country\"\n  \n  # tidy data frame and add indicator name as variable\n  indicator <- indicator %>%\n    gather(year, value, -1, convert = TRUE) %>%\n    mutate(value = as.numeric(value),\n           variable = ifelse(!is.na(inc_name), inc_name, inc_fullname)) %>%\n    select(country, year, variable, value)\n}\n\n# use default name\n# (import_gapminder(\"data/indicator hiv estimated prevalence% 15-49 (1).xlsx\"))\n# \n# # use custom label\n# (import_gapminder(\"data/indicator hiv estimated prevalence% 15-49 (1).xlsx\",\n#                   inc_name = \"hiv_15_49\"))\n```\n\n## Can I use some different data?\n\nYES! If you have another dataset around which you want to build an interactive visualization, go ahead! Just check in with me before you proceed.\n\n# Requirements for a sucessful app:\n\n* Need either multiple tabs (content in Shiny part I) or a dashboard (content in Shiny part II) with multiple plots.\n* Ideally at least three plots with some narrative component connecting them to one another. \n* All plots should adhere to the same principles of design we have discussed over the quarter\n* Ideally you have some variety in plot types (e.g. not all bar plots)\n* Prefer you use a Shiny theme to make it a little more polished than the baseline shiny app using [Shiny Themes](https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/) (discussed in class) or other theme approaches like [thematic](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/?_gl=1*10f2rmo*_ga*MTk0NTgzNTU1NS4xNzM1MjM4NzAx*_ga_8QJS108GF1*MTc0MTAxNzM0OS4xMy4wLjE3NDEwMTczNTQuMC4wLjA.*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTc0MTAxNzM0OS4yMS4wLjE3NDEwMTczNTQuMC4wLjA.) or (advanced) [theming (bslib)](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/theming/index.html?_gl=1*10f2rmo*_ga*MTk0NTgzNTU1NS4xNzM1MjM4NzAx*_ga_8QJS108GF1*MTc0MTAxNzM0OS4xMy4wLjE3NDEwMTczNTQuMC4wLjA.*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTc0MTAxNzM0OS4yMS4wLjE3NDEwMTczNTQuMC4wLjA.).\n\n# What do I submit?\nSubmit the link to your shiny app!\n\n## Grading\n\nYour visualization will be evaluated using the following criteria:\n\n* Is it truthful?\n* Is it functional?\n* Is it beautiful?\n* Is it insightful?\n* Is it enlightening?\n\nIn addition to the visualization and accompanying narrative, write an approximately 500 word explanation defending your design choices. This includes (but is not limited to):\n\n* What is the story?\n* Why did you select this graphical form?\n* What is the role of interactivity? How does it enhance your ability to tell the story and communicate the data?\n\n## Submission details\n\nSubmit your visualization and analysis as a single R Markdown document rendered using the `html_document` output format. If you build a Shiny app, deploy it on [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io) and include a link to it in your submission on [github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/QiYvVFqi). Include your design explanation in a separate tab in the shiny app.\n\n"},"formats":{"hugo-md":{"execute":{"fig-width":8,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":true,"output-divs":false,"output-ext":"md","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"variant":"+autolink_bare_uris+emoji+footnotes+gfm_auto_identifiers+pipe_tables+strikeout+task_lists+tex_math_dollars+yaml_metadata_block+definition_lists+smart","shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"default-image-extension":"png","to":"markdown_strict+raw_html+all_symbols_escapable+backtick_code_blocks+fenced_code_blocks+space_in_atx_header+intraword_underscores+lists_without_preceding_blankline+shortcut_reference_links","wrap":"preserve","filters":[],"output-file":"assign5.md"},"language":{},"metadata":{"revealjs-plugins":[],"title":"Assignment 5","date":"2025-03-05T13:30:00-06:00","publishDate":"2019-03-01T12:25:00-05:00","draft":false,"summary":"Interactive graphics using Shiny or animation"}}}}
