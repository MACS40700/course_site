If you have another dataset around which you want to build an interactive visualization, go ahead! Just check in with me before you proceed.\n\n## Grading\n\nYour visualization will be evaluated using the following criteria:\n\n* Is it truthful?\n* Is it functional?\n* Is it beautiful?\n* Is it insightful?\n* Is it enlightening?\n\nIn addition to the visualization and accompanying narrative, write an approximately 500 word explanation defending your design choices. This includes (but is not limited to):\n\n* What is the story?\n* Why did you select this graphical form?\n* What is the role of interactivity? How does it enhance your ability to tell the story and communicate the data?\n\n## Submission details\n\nSubmit your visualization and analysis as a single R Markdown document rendered using the `html_document` output format. If you build a Shiny app, deploy it on [Tableau Public](http://www.shinyapps.io) and include a link to it in your submission on [github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/VXiJO03N). Include your design explanation a document on GitHub. Note that expectations remain the same regarding an explantion of your data, github organization, etc. \n\n"},"formats":{"hugo-md":{"execute":{"fig-width":8,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":true,"output-divs":false,"output-ext":"md","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"variant":"+autolink_bare_uris+emoji+footnotes+gfm_auto_identifiers+pipe_tables+strikeout+task_lists+tex_math_dollars+yaml_metadata_block+definition_lists+smart","shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"default-image-extension":"png","to":"markdown_strict+raw_html+all_symbols_escapable+backtick_code_blocks+fenced_code_blocks+space_in_atx_header+intraword_underscores+lists_without_preceding_blankline+shortcut_reference_links","wrap":"preserve","filters":[],"output-file":"assign4.md"},"language":{},"metadata":{"revealjs-plugins":[],"title":"Assignment 4","date":"2024-02-28T13:30:00-06:00","publishDate":"2019-03-01T12:25:00-05:00","draft":false,"summary":"Tableau Dashboard"}}}}
