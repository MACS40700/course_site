Critiques should include both positive and negative aspects - what did the author do well? What are the weaknesses of the visualization? How could the truthfulness of the visualization be improved?\n\n#### Finding a visualization\n\nSome good resources for finding visualizations to critique:\n\n* Academic journals/books in your field which include graphs or charts (you don't have to find some super-duper high tech interactive graph on the web)\n* [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/)\n* Nathan Yau's [Flowing Data blog](http://flowingdata.com/)\n* [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) or [The Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot) - or really any other data journalism site\n\n#### Submission details\nAll work will be performed inside a version-controlled GitHub repo. Create your project repo by going [to this link on github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/fLOfyUGC)\n\nBe sure to include a link to the original visualization in your critique. Submit your critique as a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) formatted document that can be read directly in the repo on GitHub. Write either in the original `.md` file or write it as an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document rendered using the `github_output` format.\n\n<!--## Part 2: `ggplot2` and the grammar of graphics (10 points)-->"},"formats":{"hugo-md":{"execute":{"fig-width":8,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":true,"output-divs":false,"output-ext":"md","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"variant":"+autolink_bare_uris+emoji+footnotes+gfm_auto_identifiers+pipe_tables+strikeout+task_lists+tex_math_dollars+yaml_metadata_block+definition_lists+smart","shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"default-image-extension":"png","to":"markdown_strict+raw_html+all_symbols_escapable+backtick_code_blocks+fenced_code_blocks+space_in_atx_header+intraword_underscores+lists_without_preceding_blankline+shortcut_reference_links","wrap":"preserve","filters":[],"output-file":"assign1.md"},"language":{},"metadata":{"revealjs-plugins":[],"title":"Assignment 1","date":"2025-01-10T12:25:00-05:00","publishDate":"2019-03-01T12:25:00-05:00","draft":false,"summary":"Graph critique"}}}}
