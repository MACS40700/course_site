Student may work individually or in teams of up to three. Students should identify early in the term a research question or topic of substantive importance to themselves, then use the skills developed in this course to design and present a visualization which explains the results. The form of this deliverable can take any number of forms:\n\n* A research paper with a substantial visualization component\n* A web site with a substantial (static) visualization component\n* An interactive web page built using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), or [D3](https://d3js.org/)\n\n## Deadlines\n\nBy the end of the fifth week, students should select a topic and submit a proposal (see Assignment 3). <!--Students will present their projects to the class on **Wednesday, March 31**. Projects must be fully complete and submitted for grading by **Sunday, June 4 at 11:59 pm**. -->\n\n## Assessment\n\nYour project will be assessed on the following criteria:^[Drawn from chapter 2 of *The Truthful Art: Data, charts, and maps for communication* by Alberto Cairo.]\n\n* Is it truthful?\n* Is it functional?\n* Is it beautiful?\n* Is it insightful?\n* Is it enlightening?\n\n\n## Final Deliverables\n\nSubmit final deliverables to your GitHub repo by **March 5 at 11:59 pm**.\n\nThe final deliverables include:\n\n* **Visualization**: the final product of your project. This could be a Markdown/HTML/PDF file of your research paper, a link to a Shiny app or web page hosting your visualization, etc. If this is located outside of the GitHub repository, make sure to include a link in your `README.md` file.\n* **Paper**: a 4-6 page paper to supplement your visualization explaining your major design choices. Expected components are:\n  * **Introduction** - an explanation of the problem/research question and the motivation for solving it.\n  * **Methods** - a detailed explanation of the visualization techniques you employed to solve the problem/answer the question.\n  * **Results/discussion** - what has the audience learned from your work? How is the visualization truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and/or enlightening?\n* **Readme**: In the repository's `README.md`, include a brief project description and instructions for a user to execute your code on their own computer (e.g. what software/packages to install, instructions to obtain data if not included in repo). Aim for your project to be *reproducible*. If you work with a partner, include a description of which components each of you contributed to the project.\n* **Code**: an implementation of your source code. Make sure your code is well-documented and interpretable to outsiders.\n\n## Getting started\n\nAll work will be performed inside a version-controlled GitHub repo.
