You may work in groups of up to three individuals for this assignment. \n\nYou will need to provide a minimum of three graphs and a maximum of five. All graphs should be essential for understanding your research question of interest, well-designed, polished, and clear to an outside reader. There will be an accompanying writeup that has two components: a discussion of the findings in the graphs and an assessment of the overall design. \n\n\n## Assessment\n\nYour project will be assessed on the following criteria:^[Drawn from chapter 2 of *The Truthful Art: Data, charts, and maps for communication* by Alberto Cairo.]\n\n* Is it truthful?\n* Is it functional?\n* Is it beautiful?\n* Is it insightful?\n* Is it enlightening?\n\n\n## Final Deliverables\n\nSubmit final deliverables to your GitHub repo.\n\nThe final deliverables include:\n\n* **Visualization**: the final product of your project. This could be a Markdown/HTML/PDF file of your research paper, a link to a Shiny app or web page hosting your visualization, etc. If this is located outside of the GitHub repository, make sure to include a link in your `README.md` file.\n* **Paper**: a 2-3 page paper to supplement your visualization explaining your major design choices. Expected components are:\n  * **Introduction** - an explanation of the problem/research question and the motivation for solving it.\n  * **Methods** - a detailed explanation of the visualization techniques you employed to solve the problem/answer the question.\n  * **Results/discussion** - what has the audience learned from your work? How is the visualization truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and/or enlightening?\n* **Readme**: In the repository's `README.md`, include a brief project description and instructions for a user to execute your code on their own computer (e.g. what software/packages to install, instructions to obtain data if not included in repo). Aim for your project to be *reproducible*. If you work with a partner, include a description of which components each of you contributed to the project.\n* **Code**: an implementation of your source code. Make sure your code is well-documented and interpretable to outsiders.\n\n## Getting started\nAll work will be performed inside a version-controlled GitHub repo.
