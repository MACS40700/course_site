## Integrating Tableau into a workflow

* Use coding platform of choice to get data cleaned and sorted
* Can use as a standalone or integrate into workflow
  * For this session, we will only focus on Tableau Desktop (not connecting to servers)


---
## Getting started:

* Apply the same design principles we've come to know and love so far: 
  * think through the sketch
  * know your data
  * consider what you are trying to do


---
# Dashboards
Offers an opportunity to get a high-level view of your data. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_url("https://www.tableau.com/dashboard/what-is-dashboard")
```

---
## Comparisons

```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_url("https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/dashboard-showcase/portland-office-community-civic-life-p-card-report-dashboard")
```


---
# Think about how to provide overall summary

* What is your data source? 
* What is your question? 

---
## Exercise: baby name data

You can choose any year -- today's examples will cover 2023 and 1880. You can follow along or choose a different year!

## Basic visual: 2023

Start from a rule of threes with a general focus on getting a handle on what is happening. Think about these questions and the best way to visualize!

1. Overall stats: how many babies are born and genders?
2. Top names -- overall and by gender
3. How much 'space' does the most popular name take up (e.g. proportion of all names)?

Now, replicate with 1880 (separately).


---

## Intermediate visuals: 2023 vs 1880
Adding a second year allows us to open up new possibilities using comparison (changes, what is new/old/constant, etc.)

--

* Consistency: names that were popular in both time periods?
* Names that were popular but aren't any more?
* Names that are `new'? 
* Names moving from one gender to another?

# Recap

* Tableau can be a powerful tool
* Options to integrate with R or Python
* Design principles still apply
