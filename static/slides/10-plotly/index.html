# Plotly

plotly is an R package for creating interactive web-based graphs via the open source JavaScript graphing library plotly.js.


As of version 2.0 (November 17, 2015), graphs created with the plotly R package are rendered locally through the htmlwidgets framework.


Plotly graphs are great as they have a nice interactive/mouseover component.

## Colorscales 
Just like in ggplot, you can color by variables. 


``` r
plot_ly(data = iris, x = ~Sepal.Length, y = ~Petal.Length, color = ~Species, height = 300)
```

# Recap

* Plotly is another way to plot things as it offers interactivity. It can be used in R or Python and the plots can be quite nice if you're making slides or anything that's going to be online in some way. 

* Sometimes you can incorporate ggplot elements and then render in ggplot

* Just about any plot you make in ggplot you can make in plotly
  * Boxplots
  * Bar plots
  * Scatter plots
  * Line plots
  * ... etc. ...

## Grading: how to interpret, focus, and improve

* Look at rubric and comments. Focus on which 'bin' you are in and how to improve. 
* Most people will mostly fall in 'satisfactory' bin. Few will be exceptional/excellent. 
  * Think of satisfactory as meeting the mark and Excellent as being used as an example of what/how to do the assignment

---
# A3: Plotly

* Six plots: two groups of three
* Each group: one draft, one polished, one 'alternative option'
  * This means displaying the exact same data in a different way -- can experiment with different facets or representations
* **CAN BUILD** on prior work (it's ok to incorporate feedback on A2)
